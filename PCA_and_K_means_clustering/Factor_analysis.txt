#FACTOR ANALYSIS ASSIGNMENT


#hi everyone, and welcome to the factor analysis problem set.

CourseEvaluationData <- read.csv("~/Documents/The_New_School_M.S./Spring_2016/Advanced_Quant_TA/Factor Analysis/Assignment/CourseEvaluationData.csv")

#let's first reduce the dataset to the variables that we wish to analyze using this method.

ced_likerts_for_analysis <- CourseEvaluationData[,20:28]

#create a correlation matrix for analysis

ced_matrix <- cor(ced_likerts_for_analysis)
#make it a little more readable by reducing # of decimal places
#ced is an abbreviatioon of CourseEvaluationData
ced_matrix <- round(ced_matrix, 2)

View(ced_matrix)

#1)	Interpret the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy, Bartlett’s test of Sphericity, and determinant in this case. What do these mean?


#Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin

KMO(ced_likerts_for_analysis)

#Bartlett's test of Sphericity
cortest.bartlett(ced_likerts_for_analysis)

#determinant
det(ced_matrix)


#2)	How many factors  (components) should you choose? Why? 
#we will be using a varimax rotation.

pc1 <- principal(ced_likerts_for_analysis, nfactors = 9, rotate = "varimax")

#print the output just by stating the name of the object we created. This will list the relevant information in the console.

pc1

#what about our eigenvalues?

print(pc1$values)

#plot of eigenvalues
plot(pc1$values, type = "b")

#Based on your interpretation of your eigenvalues, change the nfactors to the number of factors you wish to specify. 
#use a varimax rotation for your chosen # of factors, as demonstrated below.

pc2 <- principal(ced_likerts_for_analysis, nfactors = INSERT_NUMBER_OF_FACTORS_YOU_WANT_HERE, rotate = "varimax")

pc2 <- principal(ced_likerts_for_analysis, nfactors = 3, rotate = "varimax", scores = TRUE)

#print our results
pc2


#3) Do the communalities concern you for any of the variables? 

#examine h2 in output.

#4)	What percentage of the variance does your factor solution explain?

#examine second part of output.

#5)	Did the factors achieve simple structure? (no item cross load at .4 or more)

print.psych(pc2, cut = .4, sort = TRUE)

#interpret results in console

#6)	Explain all three factors in plain English. Use the rotated factor solution in this determination. A paragraph will suffice.

#no R code

#7)	Do you have any concerns about reverse coding?

#no R code

#8)	Perform a reliability analysis (using Cronbach’s Alpha) for your factors that are composed of more than two variables

factor1 <- ced_likerts_for_analysis[, c(1,2,3,4,5)]
factor2 <- ced_likerts_for_analysis[, c(7,6,9)]

alpha(factor1)
alpha(factor2)

#9)	Advanced extenstion: regress each of the three factors (three regressions) on whether the professor was Male, salary, and years of experience. What do the results show?

CourseEvaluationData <- cbind(CourseEvaluationData, pc2$scores)

#use previous regression instructions from assignment 1.

#10)	 Write up your results in a page or less. Use Andy Field’s examples as a guide.
