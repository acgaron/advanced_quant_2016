#remember this from the lecture? This is how I tell R to ignore anything after a hashtag. it becomes very valuable for keeping track of your code!

#this is the import command. You will not remember this because we just used import file from the upper right.
nbastats_advanced_quant <- read.csv("~/Documents/The_New_School_M.S./Fall_2015/Independent_Study/nbastats_advanced_quant.csv")

#This command lets us see our data. As discussed, it is the only command I can think of that actually is capitalized 

View(nbastats_advanced_quant)

#this command gets the structure of our data. It tells us how many columns we have (variables) and how many rows we have *(observations)
#it will also tell us what kind of data we are working with. Rememeber numerical vs character? This is how we get that info (initially)

str(nbastats_advanced_quant)

#this command was a trick! all new objects that we create must be on the LEFT side of the <-. The Right side consists of the functions we want to use to create this new object.
#this command will return red

nbastats_advanced_quant <- nba

#this is the actual command that will allow us to rename our objects to something more managable. Here we renamed nbastats_advanced_quant
#to nba for ease.

nba <- nbastats_advanced_quant

#say we want to know how many players play for each NBA team. we will create a frequency table. Don't forget you need dataframe$variable you want to work with.

table(nba$Tm)

#the above will just print out our results in the console window. what if we want to create it as a new object that we can work with?

team_table <- table(nba$Tm)

#this allows us to store our new table as a object that we can recall whenever we want.

#to see this object, we type:

View(team_table)

#now we can see it in the console.

#if we want to export our new table out of R, we write a .csv file

write.csv(team_table, file = "Team Table.csv")

#we can also look at individual variables. if we want a brief summary, we just use the summary command, like below. here we will look at summary statistics of points scored in the nba

summary(nba$PTS)

#great! but what if we want to know the players that averaged more than 20 points last year? we will create a subset function.
#the subset function is a great way to break down your data to analyze what you care about, while leaving the main dataframe intact.
#this creates a new objec that we can use and analyze as we please.

top_ten <- subset(nba, PTS > 20)

#now if we want to view our new dataset, we use 

View(top_ten)

#and there we go! that concludes our R code for today.
